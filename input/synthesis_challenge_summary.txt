        Functional Requirements
        The basic requirements that determine if your design will be considered

        to be working or not are as follows:                                                                                                E

           • The direction of rotation shall be maintained. “if the input shafts
             rotates counter-clockwise, the output shaft shall also rotate counter-
             clockwise. Think about how that can be achieved, you might want to
             re-watch the videos”.

        Other requirements and constraints
        The following requirements and constraints (among other) set further bound-
        aries for acceptable solutions.

           • Maximum number of shafts that can be used: 8, “but think about the
             implications of using many shafts for the Objective Function”.


                                              1
   • All holes (H1-H13) are fixed in position, only hole H14 can be consid-
     ered a slot. This allows a maximum movement of 1.51cm to the left
     and right.

Objectives
Your design shall at the same time minimise the number of shafts used,
the size of the gears and the distance of repositioning hole 14. This is
summarised by this function:
                                         N
                                         !
                 min : P = x · N + y ·       (Π · rn2 ) + z · lr3
                                         n

   Where:
           $7            $             1
   • x = gear , y = 0.1 cm 2 , z = 10 cm
   • N = overall number of gears
   • r = radius of each gear [cm]
   • lr = distance of repositioning the output gear [cm]

Description
One part of the mark you are about to receive for this assignment is deter-
mined if your design fulfils the requirements. The other part is determined
by how well your particular design performs - in other words: “how well you
minimise the Objective Function in comparison to the rest of the class, so:
Yes! This is a challenge”.
